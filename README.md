## About qml_template

This is a QML GitHub template for getting up and running with QML quickly.

## Getting Started

### Use the GitHub template
First, click the green `Use this template` button near the top of this page.
This will take you to GitHub's ['Generate Repository'](https://github.com/FaZeRs/qml-project-template/generate)
page.
Fill in a repository name and short description, and click 'Create repository from template'.
This will allow you to create a new repository in your GitHub account,
prepopulated with the contents of this project.

After creating the project please wait until the cleanup workflow has finished 
setting up your project and committed the changes.

Now you can clone the project locally and get to work!
